    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, but because of its close proximity when being farmed it can also be found in oat, barley, and rye. A lot of times these are also manufactured in the same processing plants.</p>
    <h2>How can you be sure that Everything Gluten Free is safe for you?</h2>
    <p>Itâ€™s in the name. We are a 100% Celiac friendly restaurant. All products are created right in our restaurant. All items are prepared fresh per order in our certified gluten free kitchen. No items on our menu contains gluten.</p>

    <h2>What can you expect when you come into our restaurant?</h2>
    <p>A member of our compassionate, courteous staff will greet you at the front door with a smile. If a booth is available they will then take you to your booth and offer you some of our deliciously delectable gourmet rolls or bread sticks. It is offered
      to anyone who comes in. They will then proceed to ask you what you would like to drink and hand you your menu. They will return to your table with your drinks and if you are ready, they will take your order and return to your table to refill your
