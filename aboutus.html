      <h2>About us</h2>
    <p id="aboutus">Everything Gluten Free was established in 2017, by owner Danelle VanVleet.  She came up with the idea of Everything Gluten Free after being tired of not having a strictly gluten free restaurant that she can go to. Danelle herself has Celiac and has been living a gluten free life style for the past six years.
    She loves food, she loves making people feel good, and she absolutely loves to inform people about the different ways that the proper food can help people feel better.  Before becoming a restaurant owner Danelle used to be a massage therapist and would give little hints here and there about different ways to help people feel better through food.
    It is Danelle’s goal to give her customers the compassion and care that she has always wanted in a restaurant.  Danelle teaches each employee the proper procedures to ensure that the food is delicious and safe for those with minor to severe gluten allergies. </p>
